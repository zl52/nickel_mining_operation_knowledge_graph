In June 2013, Royal Nickel completed a bankable feasibility study at Dumont outlining an open pit operation with a 33-year mine life. During phase one of the operation (2016-2020), Dumont would process 52,500 mt/d to produce 33,000 mt/y Ni, 1,000 mt/y Co, and 15 million oz/y PGM.

An expansion to 100,000 mt/d would be completed in year five at a cost of $700 million which would increase production to 49,000 mt/y Ni, 3,000 mt/y Co, and 23,000 oz/y Pt+Pd at cash costs of $4.29/lb Ni. Production could begin in late 2015. (Royal Nickel PR 11/1/11)_x000D_

	In November 2010, Royal Nickel announced an offering to fund further exploration and prefeasibility studies at Dumont. Studies had assessed Dumont as either an 80,000 mt/d mine or 100,000 mt/d mine.  At 80,000 mt/d, Dumont would produce 52,000 mt/y Ni at cash costs of $3.96/lb over its 31-year mine life.  Capital costs would be $2.02 billion.  The larger 100,000 mt/d case would require $2.3 billion to build and would produce 64,500 mt/y Ni at cash costs of $3.87/lb over a 25-year mine life. Both cases would have sustaining cost of over $1.1 billion. (Royal Nickel Pros 11/12/10)_x000D_
	During 2008,  Aker modified the conceptual study to incorporate updated resources and metallurgical information.  The updated study estimated production of a 75,000-mt/d mine to be 56,700 mt/y Ni over a 21-year mine life.  Cash costs would be about $4.29/lb with capital costs of $1.2 billion.

  	In February 2010, it was reported that an independent feasibility study for development of Intex's Mindoro lateritic nickel-cobalt project had found that an operation capable of producing 52,700 mt/y of nickel would cost about $2.46 billion. the cost included a $339 million contingency, and based on mining equipment, conveyor, processing plants, refinery, wharf and related infrastructure.  The study, by consultant Aker Solutions, included saprolite mineralization as well as limonite, representing a change to original plans to treat only limonite. The plan included an open pit mine producing 6 million mt/y of ore, to be transported 43 km by conveyor to the coast, where a processing plant would be located near Pola. (MJ 2/26/10)_x000D_
	In August 2008, it was reported that Intex planned a number of changes to the first stage of development, leading to slightly higher capital costs, but lower cash operating costs. A revised prefeasibility study outlined capital costs estimated at $2.2 billion for a high-pressure acid leaching operation, compared with the previous estimate of $2 billion.

	Intex planned to develop a second stage of operations at Mindoro to exploit saprolite mineralization, forecast to double output to 80,000 mt/y nickel-in-MSP, plus an additional 700 mt/y of cobalt, and to reduce cash operating costs to $2.00/lb. Capital costs for stage two were estimated at an additional $960 million, for overall estimated capital costs at Mindoro of $3.2 billion (previously $2.9 billion), including a contingency of $526 million.

	In late February 2008, a scoping study, which considered Intex's Stage-2 expansion plans for the Mindoro HPAL processing facility to incorporate saprolite processing circuits, was completed by Aker Kvaerner. _x000D_
	The scoping study was based on input of 4.8 million mt/y of limonite ore and a similar amount of saprolite ore. The limonite ore had 0.89% Ni and the saprolite ore was 1.18% Ni. The plant production for stage-1 was projected at 70,620 mt/y mixed sulphide containing 39,400 mt/y Ni and 3,020 mt/y Co. The combined stage-1 and -2 would produce 137,100 mt/y mixed sulphide containing 80,000 mt/y Ni and 3,740 mt/y Co._x000D_
	The estimated capital cost for stage-2 was $960 million, composed of $300 million for the expanded process plant and $260 million for additional process packages.  (Index PR 2/25/08) The prefeasibility study for the first stage estimated capital costs at $2 billion, giving a combined capital cost for both stages of $2.9 billion. (MJ 2/29/08) _x000D_
	In February 2008, estimated capital costs for the first stage development of the project had risen to $2 billion from $1.4 billion forecast last year, but Intex noted planned output had risen slightly from 37,000 mt/y Ni to 40,000 mt/y Ni. _x000D_
	The first stage was designed as a 7 million-mt/y open pit mine. The processing plant would use two autoclaves to process limonite mineralization to produce 40,000 mt/y Ni and 3,000 mt/y Co in a mixed sulphide product (at about 55% Ni). Nickel recovery was estimated at more than 94%. (MJ 2/1/08)_x000D_

	By November 2007, the project capital cost had increased to $124 million since the bankable feasibility study 2006.

	In late May 2007, The European Investment Bank and Barclays Capital provided a senior debt financing facility of up to $60 million for the Munali project. As part of the requirements associated with this facility, Albidon  completed a nickel hedging program over the debt service period between June 2009 and December 2013.  Albidon forward hedged 9,020 mt (164 mt/m), which represented less than 15% of the project's expected payable Ni production, and no more than 26% of payable Ni from production in any one year. The hedging was to begin in June 2009 which would allow for full production ramp up from mid-2008 and provides exposure to the spot price of Ni for the first 12 months of production.

	In December 2006, after protracted negotations with several major nickel companies, Albidon signed offtake and financing agreements with China's Jinchuan Group.

Jinchuan agreed to purchase 100% of annual Sally Malay concentrate production on a life-of-mine basis. The offtake agreement would represent revenue to Sally Malay of approximately A$420 million over the initial project life of 5.5 years, based on a nickel price of $3.25/lb and an exchange rate of $/A$0.58._x000D_

	In addition, Jinchuan and Sino were also considering financing 100% of the cost of a bankable feasibility study into the production of an added value nickel/cobalt intermediate product at Sally Malay from low grade flotation concentrate. The aim was to select an appropriate technology that could increase the metallurgical recoveries to +95% and provide a product (mixed sulphide or carbonate) that could be refined directly, thereby increasing the overall payability of the contained metals.

   In mid-1994, North Broken Hill Peko estimated total development costs to be about A$420 million.  (MJ 7/8/94)_x000D_
	In 1992, Dominion's estimated capital costs increased from A$350 to A$480 million primarily because of change of scope.  The A$350 million projection reflected contract mining, which was no longer being considered.  This estimate included working capital.
